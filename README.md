# Lab01
1. [basics](./basics/Main.java) * I spent 2 hours to complete this assignment

- Created basics directory 
- It contains Main Java file.

--------------------------------------------------------------

- Main Java has 3 methods :-
- pluralize: accepts a word and a number and returns a string with  an “s”.
- flipNHeads: accepts an integer n and flips coins until n heads are flipped in a row.
- clock: print out the current time second by second. 



# Lab0
1. [basiclibrary](./basiclibrary/lib/src/main/java/basiclibrary/Library.java) * I spent 3 hours to complete this assignment

- Created basiclibrary directory 
- It contains Library.Java file.

--------------------------------------------------------------

- Library.Java  has 4 methods :-
- **roll function**  that accepts an integer n and rolls a six-sided dice n times then return the values in an array .
- **fuction containsDuplicates** tells you whether the array contains duplicate values or not.
- **calcAverage** takes in an array of integers and calculates the average values .
- **arrayOfArrays** takes in an array of arrays, calculate the average value for each array and returns the array that has lowest average.

### Library.Java  has 4 test methods :-
- **rollTest** a test used to check the **roll  method** and be sure its working corectly without error , by checking the numbers of elements in the array is the same number of the n times .
- **containsDuplicatesTest** a test used to check the **containsDuplicates  method** and be sure its working corectly without error , by checking if the input array give us true  if its contain Duplicates value .
- **calcAverageTest** a test used to check the **calcAverage  method** and be sure its working corectly without error , by checking if the input array avg is the same for the corect mathematical average for the array's integers.
- **arrayOfArraysTest** a test used to check the **arrayOfArrays  method** and be sure its working corectly without error , by checking if the output  array is the array that has the lowest avg .
